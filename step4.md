## Building a Flexibile Model for Urban Visioning

### Step Four: Step down the fractal grid to create Blocks in an urban grid

#### Summary
This step will use the 'attractor point' method to group the rooms in the community into levels based on their distance from the center of the community. It will then use a looping function to step up the fractal pattern until the average of the room levels match the level of the step. 

#### Inputs
- Curves of Rooms  
- Center Planes of Rooms
- Radius of the Community Boundary
- Curve of the Community Boundary
- Block Exponent
- Community Exponent
