### Step Four: Step down the fractal grid to create Blocks in an urban grid

#### Summary
This step will use the 'attractor point' method to group the rooms in the community into levels based on their distance from a point, in this example the center of the community. 

#### Inputs
- Curves of Rooms  
- Center Planes of Rooms
- Radius of the Community Boundary
- Curve of the Community Boundary
- Block Exponent
- Community Exponent
