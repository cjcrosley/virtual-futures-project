### Step Three: Create a community boundary based on a given resource boundary

#### Summary
One of the overarching premises of this project is to create communities that are sustinable. This requires creating a resource budget to represent available resources, and then sizing the community so that consumption stays within that budget. 

This process requires a series of assumptions about the community that may need to be adjusted over the course of several iterations. This is because we must create a boundary before we design the community, and that design will determine the accuracy of the assumptions we made. 

In this chapter we will cover the calculation of electrical generation from PV panels as well as wind turbines. These calculations are estimations and will only be as accurate as the data we provide. 

#### Inputs

- **Target EUI** - EUI is generally represented in kBTU/sf per year. In this model we will represent EUI in kWh/sf per year because the community will not utilize fossil fuels.
- **Target Density** - This variable represents the number of building floors desired in a given square footage of area.
- **Resource Radius** - The radius of the Resource Boundary. This boundary will be combined with % of Boundary to calculate the actual resource area.
- **% of Boundary** - The percentage of the resource circle that will be used for electrical generation.
- **Resource Boundary % Utilization** - The percentage of the actual resource area that will be used for PV panels.
- **Turbine Hub Height** - The height, from its base, of the hub of the referenced wind turbine.
- **Wind Speed** - A list of measured wind speeds from a .EPW weather file. 
- **Wind Speed Probability** - A list of probabilities, or percentage of total, corresponding to the list of wind speeds.
- **Power kW** - A list, corresponding to the list of wind speeds, of the power generated by the wind turbine at the given speed.
