# A Fractal Community
## Building a Flexibile Model for Urban Visioning 
---

### Overview

The goal of this model is to use the visual language of 3-D modeling to design and illustrate alternate future scenarios and interventions for social, economic, and environmental transformations. Traditional modeling techniques would require hours or days to model and evaluate each iteration in the design process. By using Grasshopper for Rhino, these iterations take minutes and evaluation and analysis can become an integral part of the design process. 

Grasshopper also provides the ability to access and manipulate data in a way that would be impossible traditionally. For example, Grasshopper can be used to calculate the required height of each building in the community given a target density and a priority weight for each urban block. This would be impossible to do by hand and would require iteration and subjective guesswork to come close. The task takes less than 1 second in Grasshopper.

### Outline

This paper will break down and explain the logical steps and processes used in building a fractal urban community in grasshopper.

**The 10 Steps in the Grasshopper Model**
1. Create dimensional Cell and iteration pattern.
2. Build up a fractal grid of Rooms.
3. Create a community boundary based a given resource boundary.
4. Step down the fractal grid to create Blocks in an urban grid.
5. Discard specific Rooms and Blocks.
6. Project urban grid onto a given topography.
7. Construct rooftop articulation.
8. Layer Block levels to meet target density.
9. Calculate renewable electricity generation.
10. Create visible 3-D geometry.
