### Step Five: Discard specific Rooms and Blocks

#### Summary
Until this point we have been manipulating data and tree structures in a fairly abstract way that is difficult to visualize. In this step we will discard the rooms in the urban grid that we are not interested in order to create a functional urban pattern.

#### Inputs
- Room Rectangles
- Room Center Plane
- Transit Curves
- Growth Boundary
- 
- Room X-axis Length
- Room Y-axis Length


### Block Boundary Rectangles


### Pathways


### Internal Alleys


### Arbitrary Pathways
